RC Toy Car Interface to bluetooth


Another project developed on MafraLab HackerSpace

In this project we have stripped the car controller and only left the 2 DC motors: direction and traction

For this setup we need a bluetooth dongle, one Dual H-Bridge Driver, a arduino and a battery for the arduino. (and a toy rc car with 2 dc motors)

Later on I will post pictures of the connections

To control the car you can use a serial terminal and/or user BlueTerm a bluetooth serial terminal for android devices.
